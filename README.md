# CrewAI: Sleep Cycle Research and Blogging

## Overview

This project utilizes the power of CrewAI, a multi-agent system, to research and blog about sleep cycles. The project is implemented in Google Colab and involves two main agents: a researcher and a blogger.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to leverage the capabilities of CrewAI to conduct in-depth research on sleep cycles and disseminate the findings through engaging, informative, and humorous blog posts.

## Agents

1. **Researcher Agent:** This agent is responsible for conducting comprehensive research on sleep cycles. It scours various sources to gather and analyze data, ensuring the information is accurate, relevant, and up-to-date.

2. **Blogger Agent:** Once the researcher agent has compiled the data, the blogger agent steps in. This agent takes the raw data and transforms it into engaging, informative, and funny blog posts. The aim is to make the information accessible and enjoyable for a broad audience.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in Google Colab, a platform that allows for seamless collaboration, easy access to resources, and efficient execution of code in the cloud.

## Usage

To use this project, you need to have access to Google Colab. Once in Google Colab, you can clone the project repository and run the provided scripts. The researcher agent will begin gathering data, and the blogger agent will start creating blog posts.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- CrewAI
- Other libraries as required by the specific tasks of the agents
